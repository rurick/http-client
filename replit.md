# Package Architecture

## Core Components
- **Client**: Main HTTP client with configurable retry and timeout policies
- **RoundTripper**: Custom transport layer with metrics collection and tracing
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter and idempotency detection
- **Metrics**: Automatic Prometheus metrics collection via OpenTelemetry
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with span creation and context propagation
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system with sensible defaults

## Key Features
- **Smart Retries**: Automatic retry for idempotent methods, POST with Idempotency-Key support
- **Metrics Collection**: 6 types of Prometheus metrics (requests, duration, retries, sizes, inflight)
- **Observability**: Full OpenTelemetry integration for tracing and metrics
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and detailed error context
- **Test Coverage**: Extensive test suite with 75%+ coverage including edge cases

## File Structure
- **client.go**: Main client implementation with public API
- **roundtripper.go**: Custom HTTP transport with instrumentation
- **retry.go**: Retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
- **metrics.go**: Prometheus metrics definitions and collection
- **tracing.go**: OpenTelemetry tracing implementation
- **backoff.go**: Exponential backoff with jitter calculation
- **config.go**: Configuration structures and validation
- **errors.go**: Custom error types and error handling
